## Angular

- Use Auth0 to create authentication in your frontend application
- Use tesseract js with Angular to show all text on an image and choose the longest number 

## React

- count all the mouse clicks on any part of the page and display the count value.
- get the username value from the form and view it in the header and in /user route

## JavaScript

- Return an object with each property being true if the value is **primitive**
Original object should **not be modified**
Keep the **nesting** of the object.
The function should handle any number of **nesting depth**
For example: name inside country inside address should be `address: { country: { name: true } }`
